Important:
- Your questions and answers MUST be transformed in a way that do not infringe on the copyright of the PDF.
- Ensure that the correct answer is randomly placed within the choices rather than always appearing in the same position or same two position.
- Each letter choice (A, B, C, D) must be used equally.
- Avoid using predictable patterns when assigning the correct answer.
- Do not reference the PDF name in the question itself. Any references in the question should be full Bible verses from the passage.
- Do NOT bold any text

Generate 25 multiple-choice questions that comprehensively cover biblical measurements using the provided text.

Each question must focus on biblical units of weight, length, volume, or currency.
The provided text does not contain Bible verses, so do NOT explicitly require Bible verse references in the questions.
Each question must cite the PDF the question originates from.
The correct answer should be randomly positioned within the choices rather than always appearing in the first position.
Follow the JSON format below:

- The correct answer must be randomly placed within the choices rather than always appearing in the same position.
- Each letter choice (A, B, C, D) must be used equally.
- Avoid using predictable patterns when assigning the correct answer.
